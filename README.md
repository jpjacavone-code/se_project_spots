# Spots

Spots, a responsive web application designed to help users explore and share interesting locations through clean design. The goal of this project was to practice real-world front‑end engineering skills, building a polished interface from a Figma design, making it responsive, and ensuring it feels consistent and professional across devices.

## Description

Spots is a responsive web application designed to help users explore and share interesting locations. The project focuses on clean structure, BEM, semantic HTML, and pixel accurate CSS that mirrors a provided Figma design. It demonstrates modern front end fundamentals with layout composition, responsive behavior, and reusable components.

## Core Features

### Profile Section:

A structured layout featuring an avatar, name, description, and action buttons. Built with Flexbox to match the exact spacing, alignment, and proportions from the Figma mockup.

### Card Grid:

A dynamic section intended to display user generated posts or “spots,” arranged in a responsive grid that adapts smoothly across screen sizes.

### Responsive Design:

The layout adjusts from desktop to mobile screen size using flexible units, media queries, and a desktop first approach.

## Technical Highlights

### • Semantic HTML5 structure:

For clarity, accessibility, and maintainability.

### • Modular CSS:

Organized into components and sections for readability.

### • Flexbox driven layout:

In the profile section to achieve pixel perfect alignment.

### • Responsive design:

Adjusts from desktop to mobile screen size using flexible units, media queries, and a desktop first approach.

### • Attention to design fidelity:

Ensuring margins, padding, typography, and spacing match the Figma design.

### • Clean file organization:

Following best practices for scalable front end projects.
